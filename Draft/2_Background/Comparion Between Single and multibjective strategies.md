Comparison between Single and Multiobjective Strategies
----

# Main ideas:

- There is a paper where the comparison takes place, and the design of the experiments are designed similar to the ones found there [DOI: 10.1109/CEC.2006.1688438]
- Single Objectives produce a single result, Multiobjective produce a Pareto Front
- Therefore for comparison we use Hypervolume, Sum of Objectives and comparison between Dominating and Dominated solutions produced.
- Solutions inside pareto front or not...
