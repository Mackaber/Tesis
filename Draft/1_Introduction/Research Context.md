This research is partof an application which purpose is to make it easier the practice of the English language.

Study groups can have difficulties when trying to practce, because several of the students may lack the context of the other students which may result in a more friction on the part of the conversation. The goal is to have a fluid conversation complex enough that the students can learn new words but not as complicated so they could get frustrated. Every student  can belong to a group according to its interests and their level, however the idea es that while there can be an ideal group with all the students having the most similarinterests and similar level, they also need to have participation style and the size of the group for the benefit of the system.THe idea is that everybody can use this system so they can better learn the english language
