# Main ideas:

- Stable Roommate Problem [cite 1]
- The preference is assumed, since the individuals don't know each other
- This assumption is based on the idea that people with similar interests may prefer to be together and that they have a near experience level so they don't struggle much.
- Group size and participation style are also considered for the benefit of the system
- Group size is based on the idea that for an homogeneus participation the group needs to be small, but not too small.
- The optimal solution, is then basen in the predicted preference and the group size and participation style
- In literature there is many variations of SRP but none of them characterized in the same way as the propposed problem [cite 2]
