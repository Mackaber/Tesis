The following work finds solutions for the problem of making stable student groups, which consists in the grouping of different students for the practice of foreign languages through their level of experience and their topics of conversation of interest. It is the existence of groups where students practice the language in question, but having different possible ways of grouping students at a given time, there are also some better ways than others, according to predefined criteria. For these two possible scenarios are approached. In the first one, the problem is approached as one of single-objective optimisation or of general optimisation where it is intended to maximise the aforementioned criteria taking as weights of the same function. The second scenario is to address the problem as one of multi-objective optimisation, where tests with different genetic algorithms of the existing ones will be carried out to solve this problem. Finally, different comparisons will be made between the implementation of the mono-objective problem concerning the results obtained from the tests using multi-objective algorithms through a tool known as jMetal and another named JAMES which implements within it some of the most common genetic algorithms, in addition to some of the tools necessary to measure the performance of both algorithms to solve single-objective problems and to solve multi-objective problems. Bearing in mind that the result probably tends to be better with a multi-objective solution, it will also be determined which of these algorithms turns out to have a better performance for this specific problem.\\

The document conforms to the definition of the problem where both the origin of the problem and its technical specification are discussed to solve it. Then several objectives are listed that seek to solve the specified problem. In the next section, we talk about the hypothesis and the questions that you intend to answer if it is correct. Then, in the theoretical framework, some of the tools, methodologies, and related work that can be used to carry out the research are specified. In the methodology section, the steps that are carried out to carry out the experimentation are described in more detail. How the results will be evaluated and finally in the work plan the time needed to cover the aforementioned objectives is briefly described.
