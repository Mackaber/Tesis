  author   = "Battiti, R and Passerini, A",
  abstract = "The centrality of the decision maker (DM) is widely recognized in
              the multiple criteria decision-making community. This translates
              into emphasis on seamless human-computer interaction, and
              adaptation of the solution technique to the knowledge which is
              progressively acquired from the DM. This paper adopts the
              methodology of reactive search optimization (RSO) for
              evolutionary interactive multiobjective optimization. RSO follows
              to the paradigm of ``learning while optimizing,'' through the use
              of online machine learning techniques as an integral part of a
              self-tuning optimization scheme. User judgments of couples of
              solutions are used to build robust incremental models of the user
              utility function, with the objective to reduce the cognitive
              burden required from the DM to identify a satisficing solution.
              The technique of support vector ranking is used together with a
              k-fold cross-validation procedure to select the best kernel for
              the problem at hand, during the utility function training
              procedure. Experimental results are presented for a series of

              desirable/important. Such useful information can be incorporated
              into the genetic algorithm optimization procedure by treating the
              more challenging/important objectives as constraints whose ideal
              values are adaptively improved/tightened during the procedure to
              guide the search. Employing this adaptive constraint strategy and
              a morphological representation of geometric variables, a genetic
              algorithm was developed and evaluated through special `Target
              Matching' test problems which are simulated topology/shape
              optimization problems with multiple objectives and constraints.",

  abstract = "The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a recently developed
              evolutionary algorithm (EA) based on the swarm behavior in the
              nature. This paper presents recent advances in applying a
              versatile PSO engine to real-number, binary, single-objective and
              multiobjective optimizations for antenna designs, with a
              randomized Newtonian mechanics model developed to describe the
              swarm behavior. The design of aperiodic (nonuniform and thinned)
              antenna arrays is presented as an example for the application of
              the PSO engine. In particular, in order to achieve an improved
              peak sidelobe level (SLL), element positions in a nonuniform
              array are optimized by real-number PSO (RPSO). On the other hand,
              in a thinned array, the on/off state of each element is
              determined by binary PSO (BPSO). Optimizations for both
              nonuniform arrays and thinned arrays are also expanded to
              multiobjective cases. As a result, nondominated designs on the
              Pareto front enable one to achieve other design factors than the
              peak SLL. Optimized antenna arrays are compared with periodic
              arrays and previously presented aperiodic arrays. Selected
              designs fabricated and measured to validate the effectiveness of
              PSO in practical electromagnetic problems",
