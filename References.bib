    abstract={Efforts to improve group functioning through training have traditionally emphasized the training of group leadership. And frequently this training has been directed toward the improvement of the skills of the leader in transmitting information and in manipulating groups. In any event, effectiveness in the leader role is a matter of leader-member relationship. Identification of group task roles and of group building and maintenance roles which do actually function in processes of group discussion raises but does not answer the further question of what roles are required for "optimum" group growth and productivity. In this article, the objectives in training group members have been identified. A groups self-observation and self-evaluation of its own processes provides useful content and practice opportunity in member training. Practice in enacting a wider range of required roles and in role flexibility can come out of member commitment to such practice with help from the group in evaluating and improving the required skills.},

  author   = "Battiti, R and Passerini, A",
  abstract = "The centrality of the decision maker (DM) is widely recognized in
              the multiple criteria decision-making community. This translates
              into emphasis on seamless human-computer interaction, and
              adaptation of the solution technique to the knowledge which is
              progressively acquired from the DM. This paper adopts the
              methodology of reactive search optimization (RSO) for
              evolutionary interactive multiobjective optimization. RSO follows
              to the paradigm of ``learning while optimizing,'' through the use
              of online machine learning techniques as an integral part of a
              self-tuning optimization scheme. User judgments of couples of
              solutions are used to build robust incremental models of the user
              utility function, with the objective to reduce the cognitive
              burden required from the DM to identify a satisficing solution.
              The technique of support vector ranking is used together with a
              k-fold cross-validation procedure to select the best kernel for
              the problem at hand, during the utility function training
              procedure. Experimental results are presented for a series of

              algorithm called Archive-Based hYbrid Scatter Search (AbYSS),
              which follows the scatter search structure but uses mutation and

              multiobjective optimizers, NSGA-II and SPEA2. The results

              regards the diversity of the solutions, and it obtains very

              approach is characterized by using an external archive to store
              nondominated solutions and a feedback mechanism in which
              solutions from this archive randomly replace existing individuals
              in the population after each iteration. The result is a simple
              and elitist algorithm called MOCell. Our proposal has been
              evaluated with both constrained and unconstrained problems and
              compared against NSGA-II and SPEA2, two state-of-the-art
              evolutionary multiobjective optimizers. For the studied
              benchmark, our experiments indicate that MOCell obtains
              competitive results in terms of convergence and hypervolume, and
              it clearly outperforms the other two compared algorithms
              concerning the diversity of the solutions along the Pareto front.

               the common basis of all evolutionary algorithm (EA) variants.
               The main components of EAs are discussed, explaining their role
               and related issues of terminology. This is immediately followed
               by two example applications (unlike other chapters, where
               example applications are typically given at the end) to make
               things more concrete. Further on we discuss general issues of
               the working of EAs. Finally, we put EAs into a broader context

               last few years some proposals using a steady-state scheme have

              versatile PSO engine to real-number, binary, single-objective and
              multiobjective optimizations for antenna designs, with a
              randomized Newtonian mechanics model developed to describe the
              swarm behavior. The design of aperiodic (nonuniform and thinned)
              antenna arrays is presented as an example for the application of
              the PSO engine. In particular, in order to achieve an improved
              peak sidelobe level (SLL), element positions in a nonuniform
              array are optimized by real-number PSO (RPSO). On the other hand,
              in a thinned array, the on/off state of each element is
              determined by binary PSO (BPSO). Optimizations for both
              nonuniform arrays and thinned arrays are also expanded to
              multiobjective cases. As a result, nondominated designs on the
              Pareto front enable one to achieve other design factors than the
              peak SLL. Optimized antenna arrays are compared with periodic

abstract="This chapter is concerned with unsupervised classification, that is, the analysis of data sets for which no (or very little) training data is available. The main goals in this data-driven type of analysis are the discovery of a data set's underlying structure, and the identification of groups (or clusters) of homogeneous data items --- a process commonly referred to as cluster analysis.",
