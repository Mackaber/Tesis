While there isn't distribution information for the language levels for CEFR specifically, the IELTS has a data about the frequency distributions by percentage \cite{ielts_demographic_data_2018} which has a distribution by a given level, fortunetly these levels have their equivalence in the CEFR scale, these proportion can be seen in Table~\ref{table:results_levels}

\begin{table}[]
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    CEFR Level & Proportion \\
    A0         & 0.33\%     \\
    A1         & 0.33\%     \\
    A2         & 0.33\%     \\
    B1         & 13.0\%     \\
    B2         & 48.0\%     \\
    C1         & 36.0\%     \\
    C2         & 2.0\%     
    \end{tabular}
